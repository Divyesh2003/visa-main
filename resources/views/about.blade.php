                <h3>About</h3>  
                <p>Akbar Travels of India is the largest Travel Company in India in terms of number of IATA approved Branches, staff strength and business turnover. Flight bookings have been made simpler than ever after Akbar Travels launched its Travel Portal, Akbar travels online.com, in 2007. The portal has been successfully assisting the passenger to book cheap flight tickets both in National and International sectors. With effect from 12th March, 2014 the name of the travel portal has been changed to 'Akbartravels.com'.
                 After years of successful operations since 2007, akbartravels.com is poised for greater growth. In addition to strengthening its existing services to customers and travel partners, many new travel- related products are added to the web site. IRCTC e-train tickets are now open for booking and a number of travel agents who have signed up as partners are taking advantage of this feature.</p> 
                 <h3>Growth in India </h3>
                 <p>The growth from humble beginnings in the year 1978 as a small travel agency specializing in Gulf traffic from India to a well diversified agency providing the entire gamut of travel services was indeed spectacular. Our growth began in the southern Indian state of Kerala. Presently there are 35 branches in Kerala, spanning almost all the districts of God's own country. We also have branch offices in all metro cities of India. In-roads were made into the Northern and Eastern states of India recently, and the response from the travelling community was overwhelming. Currently, Akbar Travels have total of 57 IATA approved Branches and 40 non- IATA offices all over India serving the customers.</p>
                <h3>The Online Booking Portal</h3>
                <p>Since 2007 Akbar Online Booking Company Private Limited has been assisting the passengers to make wise decisions and smart travel plans using the one stop shopping place for their vacation and travel needs. Passengers can get the cheapest Air, Rail tickets and Hotel bookings for both domestic and international destinations. Biggest success of akbartravels.com is in gaining direct access to many of the Low Cost Carriers operating in and out of India. Akbartravels.com is already the leading web site promoting all the no-frill carriers operating domestic flights in India. This success was extended to the international segment by gaining access to low cost carriers operating to Gulf Sectors such as Air Arabia, Air India Express, Bahrain Air and Flydubai. With more Airlines added to the list, the website becomes a one-stop-shop for passengers to buy all their tickets. Holiday packages for the budget conscious passenger are promoted on Akbartravels.com website. Excellent holiday packages priced at most affordable rates are available for all tourism hot spots in India and abroad.</p>
                    <h3>Corporate Services</h3>
                    <p>Corporate Travel demands promptness and efficiency. In order to provide all travel related services to this sophisticated travel segment, understanding the requirements of the corporate traveler is of prime importance. Our aim is to provide personalized service through highly trained teams at optimum cost. All auxiliary travel services as required are provided, along with our 24 hours back up service through the Customer Service help desk. Outstanding personal service being our strong point, we assign a well experienced Account Manager to each client to build up knowledge of their specific needs and business related travel requirements. This not only ensures consistency in quality of service, but also provides us valuable insights for individual requirements. We provide all services, viz. airline tickets with competitive prices, visa services, foreign exchange, hotels, travel insurance, car pick-up and drops.</p>
                    <h3>Interstate bus service</h3>
                    <p>Some of the passengers prefer to take a sleeper bus service direct to their native village, instead of taking a flight to a city, far away from their home town. There is also the problem of getting a confirmed air ticket in the busy season at a reasonable fare. That is when Akbar Travels interstate bus service comes to the help of the passengers. We were the first Travel Agency to get government approval to open Inter-state bus booking counters at the leading domestic and international airports in India.</p>
                    <h3>Airport Ticketing Counters</h3>
                    <p>For the benefit of passengers who make last minute bookings or changes in their travel plans, Akbar Travels have opened Airport Ticketing counters at three of the leading Airports in India â€“ Chennai, Mumbai and New Delhi. These counters are conveniently located near the Departure area and provide all travel services such as air tickets, hotel bookings, holiday packages, car rental services and e-train tickets.</p>
                    <h3>Foreign Exchange</h3>
                    <p>Foreign Exchange is an integral part of international travel. All the offices of Akbar Travels are authorized to buy and sell foreign currencies. We have also established foreign exchange counters at many Airports in India for the convenience of the travellers.</p>
                    <h3>Car Rental Service</h3>
                    <p>Akbar Travels is one of the pioneers among the IATA approved Travel Agents in India to operate car rental service from the domestic and international airports in India. Today, we have well established car hire service from 11 major Airports in India, who offer modern fleet of comfortable cars at affordable rates. These cars are available for Airport transfers, city and out-station travel.</p>
                    <h3>International Operations</h3>
                    <p>Akbar Travels started its first overseas branch office in Sharjah, UAE on 15th August, 2006. Now there are 15 well-equipped offices in the UAE and some more offices are in the process of being set up. Within the short span of operations, Akbar Travels in Gulf is already among the top producing agents for most of the Airlines operating in this area. In addition to the strong presence in the retail market, we were able 
                        to enter the corporate travel market also in a big way. Akbar Travels Online also has an office in Sharjah. Akbarâ€™s holiday division is also an integral part of the UAE operations. Akbar Travels have also opened branch offices at Doha, Qatar, Muscat in Sultanate of Oman and Jeddah, Riyadh and Dammam in Saudi Arabia. More recently we opened an office in Kuwait. Operations were expanded to the United States of America, when Akbar Travels opened offices in Houston and New York. First Akbar Travels operation in the Far East was established, with opening of an office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p>
               <h3>Awards and Accolades</h3>
               <p>Being a top producing agent for almost all the airlines operating in India, Akbar Travels have been the recipients of various awards and recognitions from the airlines and other suppliers. Over the years we have built up a reputation as a reliable and professional agency and our efforts have been appreciated thanks to the excellent support from our principals. It has been a mutually rewarding relationship all the way.</p>
               <h3>Sports and Social welfare</h3>
               <p>Our Chairman & Managing Director, Mr. Abdul Nazarâ€™s enthusiasm for Football as a sport coupled with his knack for spotting and nurturing sports talents has lead to the creation of â€˜Akbar Travels Football Clubâ€™ in 2003. Now the team is in the elite division of All India Super Six Tournament. Akbar Travels Cricket team regularly competes in the prestigious Times Shield Tournament in Mumbai. Along with involvement in sports, Akbar Travels also participates in various social welfare activities. We are involved with measures like empowerment of women, child welfare, educational and cultural activities and various charities for the upliftment of weaker sections of the society.
